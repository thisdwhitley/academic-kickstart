I know I signed off and maybe no one will read this, but I am still in Antarctica.  I was supposed to leave this morning.  The flight I was supposed to be on was put on a 24hr delay from Christchurch.  So I accepted that and was going to head back to bed or watch a movie or do something.  Then I got put on the later flight (along with 50 other additional people, on an already full flight...).  That was put on a 3 hour weather delay, which would put me into Christchurch around midnight.  So I explored my options there, get a hotel and basically waste it because I'll only be there part of the night or put my bags somewhere and keep myself busy until I could check in, etc.  Then that plane got delayed another 24hrs...so I won't be leaving today.  All my luggage is already on a pallet somewhere so all I have is my carry on...
