Today is Christmas. It doesn't seem like it at all. I went to the town Christmas party last night and that is the closest it has gotten to feeling like Christmas. It was kind of neat, the party was in the Vehicle Maintenance Facility or "Heavy Shop" and you've seen some of the vehicles, so imagine the size of this place. They had tons of hor devours and chocolate and when I walked in and it actually smelled like Christmas. Christmas with a hint of gasoline and oil. They had covered all the windows and decorated it for Christmas with lights and blow up snowmen and everything. They had sofas and chairs set up in one area with a slide show of people's pictures playing. They had a stage where the carolers sang and a dance floor. They had a Piston Bully (one of the tracked vehicles) dressed up as a sleigh and a Santa sitting on the back and I got my picture taken with Santa:

I just got back from dinner and it was ridiculous (again). The lobster tail was only overshadowed by the roast duck. It was awesome, and desserts like you wouldn't believe. Of course I ate too much and drank too much and now here I am feeling uncomfortably full...again. I am going to probably take it easy tonight, but there is the McMurdo Alternative Art Gala tonight that everyone says I should go to. It promises to have some interesting stuff so I'll probably check it out, but not stay very long. I almost feel like I've got a cold coming on, not good.  
  
About last night's post; I was a little depressed and in a lonely holiday induced sadness. In reality, the fact that I have never been away from my family for Christmas should be something to be happy about. I am truly blessed and lucky and can see that now. This experience has really shed a light on what is important in life and I hope I can keep that all in perspective when I return.  
  
MERRY CHRISTMAS!!!
