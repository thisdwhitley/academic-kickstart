The wind was BRUTAL today.  I know I've said that before and I've meant it every time, but today was especially windy.  It was consistently blowing between 25-35mph.  That's fast.  It really dropped the temperature too.  At one point, I looked at the real-time weather page and the temperature was 10F, but with wind chill it was -16F (the wind was blowing 39mph at that instant).  That's the coldest I've seen the weather page say.  It may have been colder before, but I haven't seen it.
