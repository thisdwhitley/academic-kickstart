Well, I got the official offer yesterday and all the accompanying paperwork.  It is simply overwhelming.  And as if that wasn't enough I got all of the medical forms and paperwork as well.  It is no wonder that this part of the process is typically started at least 8 weeks before the deployment date.  Ah well.  I am going to hustle to get it done as quickly as possible, I'm that much closer to going to Antarctica...
