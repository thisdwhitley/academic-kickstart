I can't avoid admitting it any longer, I have a cold (or something resembling a cold).  My throat hurts and my nose is both runny and stuffy at the same time.  It was inevitable that I get a cold.  In fact I was told I'd get the crud but had been lucky so far.  My luck ran out in time for the holidays.  I am not complaining.  The only reason I bring it up is because that's my excuse for having not done much on my 2 days off.  I have hardly done anything actually so you're left with a boring post, sorry.  
  
But, it is Christmas in America today, so MERRY CHRISTMAS!!!
