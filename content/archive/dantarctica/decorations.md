Someone put Christmas themed decorations up on the light poles around town.  It's kind of funny.  It doesn't seem like Christmas at all and it really doesn't look like Christmas, but now the decorations help.  Some people in my dorm have decorated their doors and put up Christmas lights, but even with that, it's hard to comprehend that Christmas is right around the corner.  This will be a unique Christmas for me.
