Just like anywhere, there is not much going on this week.  Today was no exception, but the weather was a lot nicer.  Bright, sunny and warm (of course relative).  And they are beginning to set up for the New Year's celebration.  It is called Ice Stock and is actually on January 2nd.  That's right, they've moved New Year's on us too but we do get 2 days off again.  They are setting up a stage for bands to play outside and there are going to be tents with beer/food/and crafts.  It should be pretty awesome and a long day.  I will certainly write more as I know more.
