Well, after having been gone for a full 2 weeks, my clean clothes situation has become dire.  I have simply run out.  In all honesty, I lasted longer than I thought before doing laundry.  So here's the laundry situation, each room is assigned a "laundry day" when they are supposed to do their laundry.  Not only is this to prevent everyone from getting backed up on their one day off, but also because if everyone did laundry on their day off, the water treatment plant would be in trouble.  Needless to say, today is not my assigned laundry day.   
  
Out of necessity I decided to brave the laundry room anyway.  The first trip into the laundry room was to scope it out.  I quickly realized this was really going to suck.  Big time.  I think I've mentioned that for my entire dorm, there is one male bathroom that has 2 showers and 2 toilets.  Well, the entire dorm only has 2 washers and 2 dryers for everyone, male and female.  One of the dryers is broken, typical.  So there was an open washer, but 3 piles of wet clothes stacked up waiting to use the only functioning dryer.  It is a pretty desperate underwear situation so I head back to my room to pick out underwear and t-shirts.  When sorting it out, I realized I have at LEAST 4 loads of laundry to do.  I could start now and finish on my assigned "laundry day"...  Either way, I went back to the laundry room and got a load started.  Who knows when I'll be done with this first load.  Dah well, at least I'll have clean underwear sometime before tomorrow.  I hope.  
  
On another subject, I have found out but neglected to share that I am not coming back in March like my travel itinerary states.  That is actually impossible because the last flight out of McMurdo before the winter starts in Feb. 21.  If I'm not gone by then it will be next October before I get home.  So the flight dates are all very variable.  But I won't be here as long as I thought.  Good, becuase I have a lot to get back to, but bad because I will be forced into the reality of no job sooner than expected.  The stress is starting again.   
  
Also, I stood in line tonight to sign up for the next Cape Evans Hut and Ice Caves trip.  I am supposed to go Friday...we'll see.  
  
**UPDATE:**  I uploaded and captioned a few of the pictures from Monday.  [HERE](http://picasaweb.google.com/daniel.s.whitley/VanTourObHill?authkey=Gv1sRgCOHss_jOyeWEtwE&feat=directlink). I also uploaded some of the pics from the pressure ridge.  I only captioned a few of them.  They mainly look like whiteness, but [HERE](http://picasaweb.google.com/daniel.s.whitley/PressureRidge20091124?authkey=Gv1sRgCOnoiYOPxLSO-QE&feat=directlink) they are.
