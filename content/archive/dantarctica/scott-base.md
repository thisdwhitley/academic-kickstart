I was whisked away unexpectedly to Scott Base, the New Zealand station right over the hill after dinner last night.  That's why I didn't write anything yesterday.  Sorry.  Well, Happy Thanksgiving to everyone there in the US.  I will try to write more later, but I am scheduled to go to the Ice Caves after work so I don't know when I'll be able to.  I was supposed to go to Cape Evans Hut for this same trip, but they have cancelled all trips there for the season because the road is no longer passable...maybe next year...
