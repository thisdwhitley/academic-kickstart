Well I finally got it and I think it's pretty official now, I'm going to Antarctica!  I leave on November 10, 2009 and return on March 22, 2010.  Both dates are a little later than I initially thought (and planned for), but I am very excited.  Here is my itinerary, with the flights to Antarctica still variable:

I think it is weird that I will be leaving New Zealand on Sunday afternoon and arriving in DC Monday morning, having gone through 2 countries and 4 cities.  There must be a warp zone.
