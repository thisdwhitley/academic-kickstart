I am getting FAT!  A common question is "what is the food like" and well, an accurate answer would be plentiful.  I am eating more than I ever have and not exercising at all.  I hope this changes soon, but I keep using the excuse that I'm still getting settled in...   

  

The food has been awesome so far.  Everyone else says it's boring and bland and the same as last year, but for a newbie, I'm still overwhelmed.  For each meal, they usually have 2 main courses (and 1 vegetarian main) and a few sides.  I haven't been to a meal yet where I didn't partake in each main course and most of the sides.  They call the fruit "freshies" and it is plentiful also.  I try to make myself feel better by eating those too.  Then there is desert, a few choices there as well, and if nothing tickles your fancy then there is a soft serve ice cream machine with hot fudge and other toppings.  It is hard to pass anything up and even harder to motivate to exercise.  I hope I come around soon, I can actually feel myself getting fatter.  

  

Another popular question is "what is the weather like".  It is cold, but surprisingly it doesn't SEEM that cold.  It is hard to explain.  The wind is brutal though.  It can change the feeling of everything.  The coldest day so far the temperature was 14F (again, doesn't feel all that cold) but with the wind chill it was -12F.  And, if you saw the pictures of the Extreme Cold Weather gear (ECW) you saw "Big Red" and that coat is AWESOME!  Maybe that's part of the reason it doesn't feel that cold.  But it always surprises me when I see the temperature after having just been outside because it doesn't FEEL as cold as it sounds...kind of weird and hard to explain.  

  

Oh, I almost forgot, I moved out of the "bunk room" where I had been sleeping.  In that room there were 13 bunk beds equaling 26 guys.  If you didn't see the pictures, you should check that out.  \[side note:  when my boss showed me where I was staying he was disgusted and took pictures of it and sent them to his higher ups and now, apparently, they are looking into the room and if it's a fire hazard...haha because of me\]  So I moved all my stuff into a room where I only have 1 roommate.  That is rare from what I understand and so I should feel lucky.  What I don't feel lucky about is that it's in the same building on the first floor.  In that building there is only 1 bathroom for males and 1 bathroom for females.  While I can't speak for the female facility, the male bathroom has 2 toilets and 2 shower stalls...for all the guys in the 2 story building.  Who cares, I'm in Antarctica.
