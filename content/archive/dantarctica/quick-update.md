I finally updated my mug shot picture, but I am in the lounge and my hair is matted down because I wear a hat all day because it's cold.  But you get the picture (no pun intended...ok, maybe a little intended).  
  
I have taken some pictures but it is incredibly frustrating because you cannot get the real idea of it all.  You wouldn't be able to get the real effect if I was a great photographer with a great camera, neither of which hold true.  In addition to that, the bandwidth here is unfortunately very limited so I've uploaded some pretty small teaser pics.  All the same, you can see them [HERE](http://picasaweb.google.com/daniel.s.whitley/AntarcticaFirst2Days?authkey=Gv1sRgCNvGv_bT26vgag&feat=directlink).  
  
Oh, and [HERE](http://picasaweb.google.com/daniel.s.whitley/NZDay2?authkey=Gv1sRgCLHL-6eO7YLUtQE&feat=directlink) are some pictures I took in New Zealand (I had a better connection there).
