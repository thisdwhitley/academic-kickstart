I don't really have much to say again today.  If it seems that I'm not doing much and that this blog is becoming stale, I apologize.  As my time in Antarctica is winding down I find myself more and more occupied with scrambling to find a job for when I get back as well as planning my vacation in New Zealand and Australia.  As a matter of fact I have been coming back to the office after dinner and typically spending another 2-3 hours online after being on the computer all day.  So I'm not getting out and doing as much, but I can tell you that there is a lot of water out near Hut Point now.  My supervisor say she's never seen so much water out there and she's been doing this for 9 years.  I have also heard rumors of people seeing whales in some of the water around Hut Point and also around Ob Hill!  That is a matter of timing and luck and I don't have much good of either.  I'll keep my eyes peeled for you though.  And I'll get around to posting a picture or two of the water sometime also.
