The IT party was tonight.  I think it was supposed to be the holiday party, but it's no longer the holidays, so it's just a party now.  And if you weren't aware, IT parties are where IT's at.  Ok, maybe not, but it was fun.  It was casino themed where the people with the most fake money got small gifts.  I don't like gambling, even with fake money, so I didn't enjoy that part as much.  It really surprised me that even with someone else's fake money, I still had a hard time parting with it.  Genetics.  But there was also burgers and a live band.  I like those things.  Pretty cool night overall.  
  
I had a preliminary "line handler" meeting today.  The ice breaker will be docking tomorrow morning.  It is very close now.  It is going back and forth creating a turning basin for the fuel tanker and supply ships that will be coming shortly.  For the ice breaker they won't need many people to help on the dock, but I'm going to go anyway to see what it's all about for when the big boats come in.  I think it should be pretty cool.  
  
Here is a picture that I took from my window at work.  You can tell by that spot on the upper right edge that I zoomed in.  If you look closely you can see a few people out on Hut Point and even see Discovery Hut in the very middle of the picture.  And of course, there's the Oden breaking ice and the Royal Society Mountain Range on Antarctica.
