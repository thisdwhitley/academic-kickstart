Well, I've officially been in Antarctica a month.  Nothing special about today other than that so I don't have a whole lot to say.  I did drink a Diet Dr. Pepper today.  It was delicious but it didn't really affect me one way or the other so I don't know yet if I'm going to jump head first back into the soft drinks.  
  
Since I don't really have much to say I thought I'd treat you to a picture of some penguins I saw.  This is the first and only time I've seen penguins and I had hoped to see more and provide you with a better picture and story, but this is what you get for now.  I saw them while on a hike that I still haven't posted pictures of because there weren't very many good ones.  But that was the only time I've seen penguins, I was roughly 5 or so miles away from them.  (Have I told you how you can see forever here...and that estimate is based on nothing.)  Obviously it will be hard for you to see them in this tiny picture, but they are there.  Wipe the dust off your screen and one little black speck near the middle of the picture will remain (it might help to move back and forth too).  That's them.  I saw penguins and I'm sharing that with you, here you go:
