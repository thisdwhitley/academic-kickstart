I cut my hair today for the last time in the upcoming 4 months.  I'm not shaving either...it will be interesting.  I shaved it all bald.  Anything in that picture other than my lip hair or eyebrows is just a shadow.  It is the first day of this awkward experiment.  I am going to figure out how to keep the photo on the right updated daily, check back as often as you want to check the progress...
