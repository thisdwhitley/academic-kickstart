I worked outside all day again today.  I should correct yesterday's post, it wasn't really a half a mile worth of cable.  I heard someone say that and it certainly seemed like more than a half a mile so I passed that on.  But it was really probably more like a quarter mile total.  Sure seemed like a lot more.  Today was a lot tougher, it was a straighter shot of length, but a lot longer.  And uphill so those cables got incredibly heavy as we moved along.  But, like I said yesterday, it was nice to get outside.   
  
Luckily the weather held out for us again today.  I worked most of the day without my coat and sweated most of the day.  It was snowing very minimally most of the morning, but the sun came out in the afternoon again.  I came inside around 4:30 and it felt good to sit down.  It started snowing hard again around 4:45.  Pretty good timing.
