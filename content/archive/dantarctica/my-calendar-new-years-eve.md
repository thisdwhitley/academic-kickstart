If anyone is keeping track, yes, that is in fact the same t-shirt >>>  
I'm wearing tonight as last night, but it is an updated picture. >>>  
  
Tonight is New Year's Eve here but it sure doesn't seem like it.  Are you getting tired of hearing that?  It is like I'm in some sort of alternate universe or something.  I think I saw something about a champagne toast tonight at midnight for the New Year, but since they've postponed our holiday I think I'm going to avoid that.  You know, just so I don't confuse my body.  Oh, and also because, ignorantly, I made an appointment to speak to someone at 11:30am EST time tomorrow.  That means 5:30am for me.  Gripes!  I didn't really think that through.  Ah well, my new year will really start once I get back to reality, tonight is really just a technicality.  
  
I walked up Ob Hill tonight for the first time in a while.  It is pretty tough every time and I am certain I haven't gone the same route twice.  It's just a bunch of rocks...  But I got all the way down before I realized that I didn't take a single picture.  I had my camera, but just didn't take any pictures.  And it was a nice, clear sunny day.  It's not as if the view is any less awe-inspiring, I think I'm just getting used to it here.  That really sucks and I think it's a unfortunate flaw in the human kind.  Who would have thought that I can "get used to" such a ridiculous place when the newness and excitement wore off.  It reminds me of the sadness I feel when I arrive in Colorado and I'm all giddy again just like the first time I flew in there but then realize that I lived there for 4 years and the last 3 it just seemed like another place to live.  I guess our ability to adapt (a good thing) also causes us to tend to take things for granted (a bad thing).  I don't know what I'm talking about it.
