It was a beautiful day today.  Absolutely awesome.  As such, it was determined for our health and safety that we should leave work a little early.  I took full advantage and soaked in some Vitamin D.  I did the Ob Hill Loop hike AND the Hut Point Ridge hike.  That was about 6 or 7 miles total (I think) of up and down hiking.  For my trouble I earned very painful blisters on both heals.  But I got my Vitamin D intake for the week.  I don't know what Vitamin D does or is responsible for, but I hope it helps heal blisters.
