I don't have a lot to say about today.  That seems to be a recurring theme, you didn't think this would be interesting the entire time did you?  (OK, I might have thought that too...)  Things are really winding down and I'm having to start thinking about my departure and what needs to happen.  I might even start packing tonight.  I'm a little nervous about having these enormous duffel bags to lug around New Zealand and Australia.  People kept saying I should ship a lot home in boxes, but I didn't and now it's too late.  Gripes.  Woe is me.  
  
There were a few questions about my non-Antarctica related news yesterday so I thought I'd provide a few more details.  I will be working for [24/7 Real Media](http://www.247realmedia.com/EN-US/us/company-overview.html), a digital marketing company, in [Ashburn, VA](http://maps.google.com/maps?f=d&source=s_d&saddr=Filigree+Ct,+Ashburn,+VA+20147&daddr=ballston,+arlington,+va&hl=en&geocode=FaxPUwIdixZi-ylZ49D0Jzm2iTGzd4RPmyDd1w%3BFXBDUQId9FVn-ynXPe60JLS3iTFeU4tRkcfw6Q&gl=us&mra=ls&sll=38.947585,-77.285825&sspn=0.430418,0.617294&ie=UTF8&ll=38.947661,-77.296371&spn=0.430418,0.617294&t=h&z=11) as a Senior (Linux) Systems Administrator.  There you have it.
