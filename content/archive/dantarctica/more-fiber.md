Like I said yesterday, we weren't able to get too close, it was overcast, and they were pretty lazy but here is a picture of me with Emperor penguins in the background:

The rest of the pictures are [HERE](http://picasaweb.google.com/daniel.s.whitley/PenguinTrip20100114?authkey=Gv1sRgCMjdm-PZz4azcQ&feat=directlink).  They are pretty self explanatory so I didn't caption any of them.  There were 4 Emperor Penguins.  If you notice in some of the pictures that one of them doesn't have a head, that is because it is molting.  When they molt, their heads fall off.  OK, not really, but it really is the molting time of the year for them.  The one whose head appears to be gone is actually sleeping.  Apparently when Emperor penguins sleep their heads fall off.  Again, not really.  His head was just down by his side.  Talk about waking up with a kink in your neck!  Their necks are long and flexible and they need to be since they don't have any "arms."  They use their beaks for things human men use their arms for like scratching themselves and positioning the egg on their feet (I learned that last part from watching Happy Feet).  
  
  

Overall I really don't know a lot of the scientific facts about these penguins, but here are some observations.  The sleepy one eventually woke up and even waddled around to turn in place.  That was the extent of their movement.  Another one opened its mouth a few times and it looked like it was yawning.  They didn't make any noise and they were fat.  I guess they were about 2.5 feet tall, I expected them to be taller.  One thing I do know is that their poo was green and there was a lot of it.  I'm not sure what that's indicative of.
