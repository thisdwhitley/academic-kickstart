Yesterday was Thanksgiving in Antarctica.  It was very nice.  I went to work in the morning, but technically had the day off so I didn't stay too long.  A nice co-worker invited a few of my co-workers to come over before the dinner and also organized a table for us all to sit at.  It was very nice of her.  The food was absolutely great.  It was a real Thanksgiving dinner with a ton of options, but I sure missed everyone back home.  As usual, I ate entirely too much.  
  
After the meal I was uncomfortably full so I came back to the room for a little bit.  That got a little lonely and approached depressing so I decided to go see what was going on.  I went to each bar and there was no one around.  I don't know where everyone was.  I ended up mulling around a bit and eventually people started showing up.  I ended up meeting a few people (finally) and had a pretty good time.   
  
So today I was able to sleep in for the first time in a while.  And I was feeling very lazy and thought I would just lay low and sit around all day.  Then I was sitting in the lounge and it was just gorgeous out.  So I got up and went for a hike.  I walked around Observation Hill and it was AWESOME.  A really easy hike and it didn't take too long, but it just brought it back into focus where I am.  I've heard (and apparently it has threatened to happen to me) that it is easy to get into the daily grind of working constantly and having blinders on and not really experiencing Antarctica for all it is.  I am glad I got out today and hope I can keep the motivation.  This place is awesome and it doesn't take much to see it.

I've discussed the food and my trouble avoiding eating a TON of it.  It is almost everyday that I eat a few different main courses at each meal.  So I've tossed around the idea of avoiding meat for a while.  That would limit my choices (although there's still a ton of options) and maybe be a little healthier.  If nothing else, hopefully it will cut down the volume of food I eat a little bit.  We'll see how it goes.  I'm finding that my stomach has been possessing more power than my brain lately, or at least had more influence.  And it's getting a lot bigger.
