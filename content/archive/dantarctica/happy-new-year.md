Happy New Year Americans!!!  Welcome to 2010, I've been waiting for you.  
  
Here's a story that I was going to hold until I had a picture to validate, but I'm waiting for someone to send me the picture and you know how I like to wait...  So at Christmas I volunteered to help in the kitchen.  I know, hard to believe that I'd volunteer, that's part of the reason I wanted you to see the picture with it.  The holiday meals are always a huge ordeal and they could always use help (side note:  they invite you to volunteer anytime, but I haven't other than Christmas).  I didn't sign up for anything in particular and so I didn't know what to expect (of course deep down I expected the worst, washing dishes).  When I showed up they ushered me to the back into the kitchen and it reminded me of when I worked at the Walnut except everything was at a scale of about 20 times the size.  Literally!  They make a ton of food there, daily.  So when I got back to the guy who was supposed to show me what to do I asked him what I'd be doing and he said, get this, cutting cheese...I chuckled and told him that I had plenty of experience doing that but it wasn't a joke to him.  
  
As it turned out, I cut more cheese (in the literal sense) than I had ever even seen in my entire life.  It was all kinds of cheese.  I wish I could remember the names of some of these exotic cheeses, but they were all delicious and I've had them at a many of brunches before and since.  This cheese was actually for brunch the next day too, we had to cut it up into bite size cubes.  It was monotonous and brain numbing, but it wasn't hard.  And everyone in the kitchen was SO appreciative.  I couldn't believe how nice they all were.  Either they really hate cutting cheese or they just really needed the help.  Either way it felt good to lend a hand.  So be on the lookout for a picture of me in the kitchen cutting cheese.   
  
I mumbled out loud while I was leaving "I have never in my life cut so much cheese on Christmas day in Antarctica before..."
