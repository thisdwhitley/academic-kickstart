Two days.  That's how long my exercise regimen lasted.  A measly two days.  I'm a slug.  Yesterday was a tough day at work, but my real excuse is that the wind was vicious.  I mean, it was angry and you knew it.  It cut right through you.  I thought I'd take that night off from hiking.  
  
And about tonight, I have an excuse also.  I was actually supposed to meet a guy from my dorm over at the gym at 5:30 to lift weights.  I waited until 6 and he never showed up.  I didn't do anything, but since I was technically IN the gym, I felt like I deserved a big meal, so I indulged myself yet again.  On a better note, I haven't had a dessert in about a week...that's something.  
  
Unfortunately, that's about all I have to say.  I fear that I'm falling into a routine here and that work is becoming the main attraction.  I don't want that to happen and I don't know yet what I'm going to do about it.
