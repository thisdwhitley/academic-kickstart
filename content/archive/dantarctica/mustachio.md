Not a lot to say about today really. Work has actually been kind of busy, but it's kind of busy work...but it makes the time go by. I am going to some sort of Soiree tonight which seems to be a pretty big deal. I don't know what to expect, but at least it's something. And tomorrow I am going on a hike I haven't been on yet. It is one of the one's where you need two people to go and you have to check out with the fire house and get a radio, etc. We will scale Castle Rock at the end/middle and hike back. I think it's going to be pretty awesome, but it is supposed to be cloudy so I hope my pictures come out good (I am already making excuses).  
  
And back to my facial hair, I know I talk about it a lot, but I don't have much else to talk about. So I cut my neck hair, front and back. It feels a lot better and I didn't even realize it didn't feel good before. I realized that if the rest of my beard was as thick as the hair on my neck I'd be set. Unfortunately it's not.  
  
So while I was messing with my facial hair, I seriously contemplated trimming my nasty mustache. (that stache is trash, that beard is weird) More than one person has agreed that it is gross and potentially unsanitary. And a few people have said that trimming my mustache so that it isn't in my food would be acceptable. So I really almost went for it. But I kind of want to be able to twist it into something eventually. Either way, it stayed nasty. For whatever reason I thought that "hair product" might be able to tame it. Not the case. I don't know why I thought putting hair gel in my mustache would be a good idea, but I gave it a shot. For as thin and sparse as my facial hair is, it is STUBBORN. I couldn't get that hair to go anywhere except where it was already going, pretty much toward my bottom lip. So it smelled good, but it sure made everything taste funny...
