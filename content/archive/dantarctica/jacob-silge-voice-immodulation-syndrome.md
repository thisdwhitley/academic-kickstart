Today was pretty uneventful but I did remember something I left out from the happy camper experience so I'll fill that in now.  Our instructors were awesome.  They were all relatively new, but all very knowledgeable.  It was one of the instructor's 8th day at McMurdo ever and he was out there teaching us how to survive.  He did a great job, he spoke loud enough for the large group we were in and loud enough to talk over the wind and environment.  He was so prepared and knowledgeable because his "real" job is as a guide and instructor in Alaska.  Apparently this pays more than Alaska but he prefers the diversity of the wilderness in Alaska.  He has been surviving in cold and extreme environments for the better part of his adult life.  He takes numerous expeditions every year and has a really free lifestyle.  I didn't learn all of this at happy camper, I learned it all (and a lot more) because he moved into the room beside (or somewhere near) me and it wasn't a fluke that he spoke so loudly when he was instructing us.  That was his INSIDE voice.  It is ridiculous how much this guy talks, but even harder to believe how LOUD he talks.  Either he is on the phone when he's talking over there or his roommate has a grasp on the concept of courtesy as well as the difference between an inside voice and an outside voice because all I ever hear is his megaphone lips flapping away.  I want to slap him every time I see him and cry every time I hear him (which is pretty much any time he talks while we are both in Antarctica).  
  
I really hate my facial hair and have recently considered cutting it off.  I know I said I wouldn't, but it really looks pretty crappy and doesn't suit me at all.  I had thought that I would try to go for my awesome mustache again, but I really only liked that thing because it stood out in America.  It wouldn't stand out at ALL here.  So I don't know what I'm going to do...  
  
I finally captioned some more pictures.  [HERE](http://picasaweb.google.com/daniel.s.whitley/TopOfHillAndIceCaves?authkey=Gv1sRgCIXZ_rGnxfuqoAE&feat=directlink) are some from the T-site and the Ice Caves.  And [HERE](http://picasaweb.google.com/daniel.s.whitley/HappyCamper?authkey=Gv1sRgCIqqjbLmoYXkUg&feat=directlink) are some pictures from Happy Camper.
