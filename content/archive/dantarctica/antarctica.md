I am in Antarctica!  It is hard to believe, even for me.  It is unlike anything you could imagine.  I am in temporary housing so my settle-in period might be a little extended...but who cares, I am in Ant-f-ing-arctica!   
  
We flew in on a C-17 (jet), not a C-130 (prop) like I thought.  The C-17 was a little nicer (I've heard) and got us here in 5 hours.  It was enormous and all together not a bad ride.  I got to go into the cockpit to see Antarctica while we were flying over it.  Breathtaking.  Literally.  I tried to take pictures, but you will never understand it (not from the pictures anyway).  
  
I will try to write more later, about my first impression, the experience, the sights, sounds and smells, etc. but I can already tell that it is going to be hard for me to put it into words.  I will try though.
