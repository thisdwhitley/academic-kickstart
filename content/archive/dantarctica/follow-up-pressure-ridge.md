There were some questions posted in the comments to my "pressure ridge" post, which I will try to address now.  The pressure ridge is made over a long period of time and while it could be moving while we were out there, I don't know for sure and I certainly didn't feel it moving.  They are there all the time, but the tours of them are seasonal and the season is coming to an end.  There were sections where the ice and snow was very slushy and we stepped into water/slush up to our shins so the guide said they would probably only be a few more tours for this season before it is just not doable because of the condition of the surrounding ice.  There were crevASSes and melt pools and any number of other "features" but nothing very extreme.  I tweaked my ankle in a mini cravASSe that was covered in snow.  It was tiny and not dangerous but there was an odd feeling during that half second that my foot didn't stop where I thought it would.  I thought I was a goner but managed to suppress my urge to scream.  On a similar note (not really), I made a snow angel on the Ross Ice Shelf in Antarctica.  If you didn't know anyone that had done that, now you do.  You are welcome.  
  
I have seen the gelatinous ridge first-hand as well.  Unfortunately, I may never see that again and ruined my chance to make a jelly angel (read the comments of "pressure ridge" to understand).  And I saw the article about the Scotch, that will be some expedition.  I will try to track it down.
