It snowed all night long last night and it must have snowed hard because there was about 4-5 inches of snow on the ground when I woke up.  That's right, on the ground.  Someone must have turned the volcano off last night.  So the snow and wind kept the planes from flying again.  It is pretty much off all the roads now but there's still snow sticking around in some areas.  It looks like everyone must imagine Antarctica looks like.  
  
I went to Scott Base tonight to look at souvenirs.  They have some cool stuff, but the cool shirts are all in the worst sizes and everything else worth buying is overpriced.  Except the beer, it is cheap at their bar.  I didn't stick around but was surprised at their prices (again).   
  
On another subject, I signed up to volunteer at "gear issue" earlier this week.  It is where people check out cross country skis or other random equipment.  I have never gotten anything from there, but they were looking for some help and I figured I'd see what it was all about.  I had to get my supervisor's signature and everything and supposedly someone would contact me to set up a schedule.  That was at the beginning of the week and I haven't heard anything back.  This does not bode well for my upcoming job search.
