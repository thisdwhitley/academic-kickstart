Not much to say about today really.  We went to the "Waste Barn" where all of our trash goes.  They manually sort every piece of trash that leaves this continent.  We are supposed to sort everything ourselves, and we try, but they go through it all again up at the waste barn.  Those are some hard working people doing a thankless job and now I have at least a little better appreciation for what they do.  If nothing else, I know I wouldn't want to do it.  
  
And I got a package today that I was on the lookout for since Christmas time.  Now I made it clear that I didn't want much sent here (but certainly appreciate it), but since I have been on the lookout for it, I have found out a few things about the flights that come into McMurdo.  It is not unusual to get multiple TONS of fruit and vegetables, called "freshies," on a flight.  Like 6,500lbs or more occasionally.  And sometimes a couple tons of packages and mail.  That seems crazy to me that there would be so much of that stuff.  Not to mention the tons of fuel, supplies, and people.  And it seems like a lot of weight until I realize that some planes have a weight carrying capacity of 100,000lbs.  Quick math reveals that that's 50 tons!  That blows my mind, but I guess these are planes that have carried tanks and bulldozers and all kinds of other things.  It is still hard to wrap my head around.
