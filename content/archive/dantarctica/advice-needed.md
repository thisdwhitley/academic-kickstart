I am clearly still new to this facial hair thing.  I have not yet mastered blowing my nose without everything, if you know what I mean, going into my mustache.  I mean everything!  It is gross.  It has got to be possible or else no one would ever have mustaches, right?  I have to wash my face every time I blow my nose.  And while we're talking about my nose, it is raw and bleeding from all the wiping/washing with the sandpaper they call toilet paper down here.  There you have it.
