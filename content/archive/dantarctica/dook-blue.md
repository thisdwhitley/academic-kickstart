I don't know if you noticed the color of the building in the picture from yesterday, but most buildings here are a similar drab color.  Lots of different earthy, brown tones.  I don't mind it so much, but everyone else talks about how ugly McMurdo is and how it's depressing.  It is a gripe I hear often.  Most buildings around here are really old and some actually have paint containing asbestos (I think) and are just overdue a fresh coat of paint.  So, eventually the decision was made to put new paint on the buildings.  Everyone was thrilled and there was a ton of rumors/bets on the color chosen.  Well the color was picked by some higher up, from his/her perch back in America who thought it'd be neat to match the blue color from the USAP patch on all of our jackets.  Blue is probably my favorite color, but this shade of blue is ridiculous for an area of anything over about 2 inches.  They started with painting the biggest building on station, 155.  They are making steady progress given the harsh conditions in which they have to paint.  Here is a picture of the new shade of blue chosen for McMurdo buildings (this has not been photoshopped):
