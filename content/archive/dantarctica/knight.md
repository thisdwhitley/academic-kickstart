I worked outside all day today.  Luckily the weather was pretty decent.  The clouds dissolved in the afternoon and it turned into a nice day.  Even in the morning when it was overcast and cloudy it wasn't too cold.  I was overdressed and hot most of the day.  We pulled cable.  Fiber optic cables.  About half a mile worth through 4" conduit.  It took all day and we're running the other half all day tomorrow.  It was great to be outside, but I'm exhausted now.  I hope the weather is nice again tomorrow.  
  
Today a flight finally came in and a flight finally left.  All of these people have been waiting days to fly in or out of here.  That means a lot of people were crowded onto each flight.  The season is winding down so it was odd to see so many new faces at dinner tonight.  One of the people that arrived today is [Sir David Attenborough](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Attenborough).  Embarrassingly I don't recognize the name, but everyone seems to think it's a big deal.  He's a knight, so I guess that's kind of cool.  That's all I've got for today.
