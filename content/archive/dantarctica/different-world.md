I saw a bird today and realized how seldomly I've seen living things other than human beings.  The other creatures I've seen are an enormous seal slinky-ing along the ice from a long way off.  And I stumbled into the scientist laboratory where they have the aquariums and saw some odd clam-like creatures, some starfish looking things, and weird spider type crustaceans that live WAY under the ice in near freezing water.  Besides that, there are NO naturally occurring bugs, rodents, dogs, pets, plants, anything.  It is kind of weird.  

  

It is snowing this evening.  Apparently that is odd.  Normally, what I thought was snow before was just snow/ice blowing around, not falling from clouds.  Silly me.  

  

Update on my fatness:  my roommate said he gained 15lbs in his first 3 weeks last year.  I haven't weighed myself, but I think I am on track to make that look like child's play.  He said the diet they feed us is supposed to be necessary for the people out in the cold, working hard all day long doing manual labor.  The only manual work I'm doing is my fingers on a keyboard.  I'm screwed.  

  

I haven't taken any pictures lately, but I hope to start again soon.  I took a class today so that I could hike outside of town so I will hopefully get motivated to do that and get some exercise.  I am also signed up for a trip to Cape Evans Hut and Ice Caves tomorrow night, but it is looking doubtful with the snow today and snow in the forecast for tomorrow.
