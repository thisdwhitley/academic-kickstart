Well, yesterday(s) was one hell of a day!  But I have been in Christchurch, NZ for almost a whole day now and it is awesome.  My flight to the ice has been postponed a day so I will be here all day tomorrow too.  It is hard to sneak in time to update everyone, but I am trying to keep notes of everything I want to say and hope to get everything updated once I settle into a routine in Antarctica.  Bear with me.  As a preview, I have seen and experienced SO much that you simply won't believe.  I can't wait to share it all with you.  
  
I missed a few days of picture updates, sorry.  I hope to get that down into a routine too.  (In my defense, I lost an entire day that I will never get back.  Gone.  I will never experience it.  It happened to be Friday the 13th {11/13/09})
