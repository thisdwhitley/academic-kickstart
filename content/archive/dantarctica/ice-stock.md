Ice Stock was a lot of fun.  As fun as standing around by yourself for 6 hours in Antarctica can get.  And I don't say that looking for sympathy, because I could easily have made a lot of friends here by now.  It seems to be very easy.  It's just that I haven't put any effort into it.  I got here later than everyone else and a lot of cliques had already formed and even still I think I could have worked my way into any number of them.  But I haven't.  I'm a lone wolf.  And I'm fine with that.  It is all my own doing.  So if you're reading this, consider yourself lucky because I'm simply too lazy to make any new friends.  Let's see what "Anonymous" has to comment about that.
