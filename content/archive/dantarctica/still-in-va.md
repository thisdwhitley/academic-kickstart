It is becoming apparent that my sole purpose in life is to hand over my fate and future to some complete stranger and then be forced to wait around with little-to-no communication.  That is to say...I have not left for Antarctica yet and I have no solid departure date.  I am still waiting (such is my life) to hear about my Physical Qualification status and from there work with the travel department to set my deployment as soon as possible.  Of course this is dependent on flight/ticketing availability...  
  
I have found out that everyone else has been there since October 1, but since I am only getting to go because 2 people backed out, it is OK that I'm late.  But they (and I) want me there as soon as is possible...I thought that was going to be Oct. 26th, but I was again wrong.  My bags are packed and ready to go.  I will update this page as soon as I find out.  
  
On another note, I shaved my neck (front and back).  Some people will think that is cheating.  But I was beginning to look unkempt and sloppy, not to mention that it itched like none other.  I have accepted that I will look ridiculous, but the point isn't to make me look gross and unkempt.  I don't know what the point actually is, but it isn't that.  I will probably shave my neck once a week I'm guessing.  We'll see.
