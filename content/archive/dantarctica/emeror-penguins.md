During lunch today I signed up to go on a "See the Penguins" trip in a Delta (that's those huge Orange monsters that I rode to the Ice Caves in).  These are the Emperor Penguins like the ones that you imagine, the real majestic ones like in Happy Feet.  Well it was a 50 minute ride out to where they were and a 45 minute ride back just to watch them stand there for a few pictures.  Don't get me wrong, it was really neat to see them in their natural environment, but kind of boring at the same time.  These same 4 penguins have been in the same spot along the ice road that goes out to the Pegasus Air Field for over a week.  I don't know why they're there, how they got there, or why they haven't left.  I can't imagine what they've been eating, but they were big and fat and they have obviously been...processing and getting rid of something in that same spot they've been standing in for a week.  I took a few pictures and will try to post them tomorrow, but don't get too excited, it was overcast and we had to stand pretty far away.
