This is going to be a quick teaser, but I went on a tour of the pressure ridge today.  It is where the thick, permanent Ross Ice Shelf that is fed off the giant glacier flowing down from the polar plateau collides with the less permanent "annual" sea ice (although it has been here for years).  The huge bodies of ice are forced together and create a ridge, much like tectonic plates pushed together to form mountains years and years ago.  It is pretty neat.  Just being out on the ice was an experience in itself, but the formations made here were pretty cool too.  It was whiter than white out there.  I can't describe how white it was.  And the wind was blowing the fresh snow around hard and the sky was foggy/cloudy/overcast so it was a very flat white too.  I literally couldn't see anything through the camera, I was just hoping it'd capture half of what I was seeing.  The pictures didn't turn out TOO bad, but not great.  Of course a few better than others, but you will have to wait for those too.  Here is a teaser, but pretty hard to see...squint:
