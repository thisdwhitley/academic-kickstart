Sorry to leave you hanging again.  But once again, I don't have a lot to report.  The ship is here and offloading now which means trucks, tractors, graters, loaders, lifters, cranes, etc are rumbling around 24hrs a day.  It is pretty crazy and quite noisy.  I notice most at night.  
  
I never wrote much about the supply vessel.  It is the [American Tern](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MV_American_Tern_(T-AK-4729)).  It is massive and has some huge cranes on it that make it look even bigger.  Unfortunately I was called away from my line handling duties for an important (relative) meeting.  That was bad timing, I went back down to the pier after the meeting, but they were pretty much done.  I didn't get any decent pictures of it and it is unlikely that I will.  With the commotion surrounding it and all of the new rules and regulations I probably won't be able to get back down there until it is ready to leave.  Oh well.  
  
Another thing that might not be worth mentioning, but I'm going to anyway is that I went into a new bathroom today.  That bathroom post a few days ago was gross, but it got a lot of reaction.  So when I went into a building today that I'm rarely in, I figured I'd check out the bathroom situation just to have something to report.  That bathroom smelled too!  It was in a nicer building and it smelled more of chlorine (kind of like an indoor public pool) than it did of stink, but still not pleasant.  Better though I guess.  That's what this blog has been reduced to.  My apologies.
