Not much to report today, unfortunately.  It was really, really nice weather here again today.  It might have even reached 40F if you can believe that!  I hiked again and did the same loop in about 45 minutes.  I only jogged a little bit and mostly downhill (but some up).  It is easy to get out when it is nice, the real test will be when it is cold or cloudy or windy.  I still need to figure out the apparel issue...  
  
So I have not shaved any of my facial hair, yet.  In fact I haven't even shaved my neck, front or back, in a couple weeks.  I am a slob and my facial hair sucks.  Here is a funny story that illustrates how gross and stupid my facial hair is; when I was eating rice, my mustache kept knocking some rice off the fork before I could get it in my mouth.  My mustache was playing defense.  And it is constantly getting in my drink, I have to wipe my mouth after every sip.  That is all in addition to the fact that it is sparse and spotty.  Dah well, I'll put up with it for a little while longer for your entertainment.
