Well the trip to Cape Evans Hut and Ice Caves was canceled so I signed up for a walking tour of "pressure ridges" on the ice shelf.  But that was canceled because of the weather also.  At least I tried today...now I'm just sitting here just waiting for dinner.  To get even fatter.  So no updated pictures and not really much more to say.
