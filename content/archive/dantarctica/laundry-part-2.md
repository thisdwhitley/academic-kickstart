It snowed a little bit today.  And I was only wearing my fleece, so that was bad planning on my part.  I went back to the dorm a few times during the work day to do laundry and I never picked up a different coat though, so it wasn't too bad.  And while I'm talking about laundry, I think I have gotten better at it.  I put a load in before I shower and then move it to the dryer before I go to breakfast.  Then I come back to the dorm after breakfast to brush my teeth and hopefully the load is dry (although it wasn't today so I had to go back to the dorm right before work started).  Today, for the first time, I put a load in the wash before going to lunch and then put it in the dryer before returning to work and then just left work later when I thought it'd be done.  To my surprise, it was sitting on top of the dryer...FOLDED, with someone else's clothes in the dryer.  I felt pretty bad about that.  In the past, if someone's stuff has been in the dryer, I've thrown it on the ground...or put it on top of the dryer, but never folded it!  What a nice surprise.  So I'm going to start doing that from now on, leaving my clothes for someone else to fold.  
  
By the way, if my hair looks combed/parted/anything in the tiny daily picture, it isn't.  I just have a ridiculously overpowering cow lick that makes my hair go to my left in the front.  And it is constantly matted down by my hat which has really put a damper on the picture evolution of my hair.  I was thinking it'd be big and poofy, which it would be if it weren't for the hats, but it really just looks the same daily.  Kind of a bummer.
