It has seemed cold the last few days.  Colder and colder.  I have to wonder if this is the beginning of the winter weather returning or if it's just another temporary cold spell.  Or maybe it's been this cold the entire time, but I didn't notice it until the newness and excitement wore off.  Who knows, but it snowed again today.  And it felt cold (I checked and it's not as cold today as it has been other days...)  
  
It is still never dark outside, but the mornings are kind of resembling mornings lately.  The sun is rotating in the sky closer to the horizon, so much lower that in the morning the sun is behind Ob Hill instead of above it.  So there isn't direct sunlight right when I walk out, kind of like the sun is rising but it's actually just moving to the other side of the hill.  It is still bright out when I head out in the mornings (at 4:45am) even with the sun hidden.  
  
A quick note unrelated to Antarctica:  I was offered and accepted a job in VA.  What a relief.
